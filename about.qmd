I am an applied machine learning engineer passionate about building AI-driven products to solve real-world problems. My motto is "Applied AI should always be product-driven".

Currently, I am working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Jiffy](https://www.jiffy.com/), where I build image enhancement pipelines, deploy custom in-house and open-source ML models, and develop LLM/VLM applications across different verticals. My work also spans improving search and recommendation systems and designing automated prompt-optimization workflows.

Previously at [Flixstock](https://www.flixstock.com/), I predominantly developed vision generative AI solutions, with a focus on building virtual try-on and background generation solutions emphasizing identity and pose control.

Unlike many in this field, my core background is not in computer science. My graduate and Ph.D. research experience is in computational geophysics, and I worked for [Shell](https://www.shell.com/) as a research geophysicist for about three years. I believe this diverse background helps me approach problems from unique perspectives.

I love connecting, chatting, and collaborating with new people. Whether you are a fellow professional, a new graduate, or someone interested in discussing AI-powered products, please do not hesitate to reach out.

You can also book a meeting with me using the [Calendly link](https://calendly.com/aayushgargiitr/30min).
