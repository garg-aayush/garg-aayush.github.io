I am an applied machine learning engineer passionate about building AI-driven products to solve real-world problems. My motto is "Applied AI should always be product-driven".

Currently, I am working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Jiffy](https://www.jiffy.com/), where I specialize in building intelligent image enhancement pipelines and agentic systems. My work also encompasses developing custom in-house ML models, deploying both ML and LLM models at scale and creating LLM-powered solutions for diverse verticals. I work at the intersection of computer vision and language models, building practical AI systems that deliver real business value.

Previously at [Flixstock](https://www.flixstock.com/), I predominantly developed vision generative AI solutions, with a focus on building virtual try-on and background generation solutions emphasizing identity and pose control.

Unlike many in this field, my core background is not in computer science. My graduate and Ph.D. research experience is in computational geophysics, and I worked for [Shell](https://www.shell.com/) as a research geophysicist for about three years. I believe this diverse background helps me approach problems from unique perspectives.

I love connecting and collaborating with new people. Please don't hesitate to reach out! 😊
