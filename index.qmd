I am an applied machine learning engineer focused on building AI-driven products and systems people can rely on. At Jiffy, I build image enhancement pipelines, deploy ML models at scale, and develop LLM/VLM applications across product verticals.

::: {.profile-followup}
I am currently building an in-house AI design platform, developing evaluation and prompt-optimization workflows, and exploring applied LLM fine-tuning for structured data extraction. My background is in computational geophysics, which keeps me grounded in first principles and pragmatic experimentation.
