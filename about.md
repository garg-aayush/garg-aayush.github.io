I am an applied machine learning engineer passionate about building AI-driven products to solve real-world problems. My motto is <i>"Applied AI should <b>ALWAYS</b> be product-driven"</i>.

Currently, I am working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.jiffy.com/">Jiffy</a>, where I focus on building in-house Generative AI-based image processing features and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for search and recommendation tools. Of late, we as a team focussed a lot on generating low-cost detailed structured metadata for the different assets (fonts, designs, products).

Previously at <a href="https://www.flixstock.com/">Flixstock</a>, I predominantly developed vision Generative AI solutions, with a focus on building Virtual Try-On and Background Generation solutions emphasizing identity and pose control. We constructed product pipelines around StyleGANs, Vision Transformers, Stable Diffusion, and its variants such as ControlNets, T2I-Adapters, and Dreambooth.

Unlike many in this field, my core background isn't in computer science. My graduate and Ph.D. research experience is in computational geophysics, and I worked for <a href="https://www.shell.com/">Shell</a> as a research geophysicist for about 3 years before transitioning to applied deep learning. I believe this diverse background helps me approach problems from unique perspectives.

I love connecting, chatting, and collaborating with new people. Whether you're a fellow professional, a new graduate, or someone interested in discussing AI-powered products, please don't hesitate to reach out! ðŸ˜Š
