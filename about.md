I am an applied machine learning engineer passionate about building AI-driven products to solve real-world problems. My motto is <i>"Applied AI should <b>ALWAYS</b> be product-driven."</i>

Currently, I am working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.jiffy.com/">Jiffy</a>, where I focus on building in-house Generative AI-based image processing features and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for search and recommendation tools.

Previously, I worked with <a href="https://www.flixstock.com/">Flixstock</a>, where I predominantly developed vision Generative AI solutions such as Virtual Try-On, Background Generation, and AI-generated photoshoot models with identity
and pose control.

I have a background and Ph.D. research experience in computational geophysics and worked for <a href="https://www.shell.com/">Shell</a> as a research geophysicist for almost two years before transitioning to applied deep learning. I guess, this diverse background allows me to approach AI problems from unique perspectives.

I love to connect and collaborate with new people. And, I am always open to assist and mentor upcoming new graduates. Please don't hesitate to reach out! ðŸ˜Š
